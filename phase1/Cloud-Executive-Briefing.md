## The Cloud. Youâ€™re Already Here. Do You Know Where Here Is?

- At the beginning of this part, Simon Allardice started by bringing back a phrase that is kind of well know in the cloud area: *There is no cloud, it's just someone else's computer*.
And he tries to catch our attention on the fact that if we conside that phrase we will miss what is really the cloud. So instead there is the cloud, and
it's not just someone else's computer as we will see in the next videos.

- Simon Allardice outined the fact that giving a definintion to cloud could be tricky as differents individuals at different levels (student, IT person,
Cloud developer, CIO) have a totally different view about what is the cloud computing and what it does.

- And the ways he found to come up wiht the definition of the cloud computing is by asking the question: `Could you do that before ?`

- The main and high level benefits of cloud computing are: cheaper, more convenient(easier), more faster, and bring more features. If we take the specific
example of backup, it was something we were already doing before, without cloud, but it was requiring to buy external hard drive, do manual plug in and
plugout, and we necessarily need to be in front of a computer with the external hard drive to access our data. But with cloud we can access data everywhere
there is internet (and internet is everywhere), we don't need to by and maintain an external hard drive, we don't need any manual plug in plug out.

- Simon Allardice started listing the characteristics of the cloud computing:
    - The cloud computing is possible only because of internet. So every consumer or cloud service provider need to be connected to internet.
    - The cloud computing is also based on third paty hardwares(cloud provider physical datacenters). But we don't direclty acces those physical disk inside the data center, but
      but instead we access a software that is put on top of the datacenter to mange all the request from the cloud consumers.
    - Pays as You go: Cloud computing provide self service and on demands (we don't need to make a phone calls etc, we just got the websites, do some clicks, pay and the 
    service become available).
    - Access to a pooling and shared resource instead of physic hardwares optimize use of the resource, so make them more efficient => reduce costs for users
    and finally add redundency to users data.
    
- Types of cloud services
    - Software as a service: it's a finished application running in the cloud that we can acces by a browser or running in the background or other ways.
    - Ifrastructure as a service to be able to have a deeper access to resources like, the storage, the networking, the operating system and that is possible
    with virtual machines. And the same way their redundency for simple data, we can create a save copies of virtual machines, to circumvent failures.
     And we can also to easily move ouron premise or own systems running on our own hardware into virutal machines on the cloud without any rediseignin 
     anything. The downside is for IAAS as oppisite to SaaS that you don't own is that, you have then to take care of your resource, configuration,
     maintenance, security, updates, errors.
    - PaaS, instead of getting an entire infrastructure, you get the infrastrucuture + the a full working software developemt environnent (installation
    of the web server, the database, the framework, etc). And the provider take care of maintaining and keeping everythin patched and updated
    (the OS, security, databse, web server, framework etc).
    Additionnaly PaaS provide features like analytics, auto scaling,
